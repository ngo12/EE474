HW 2 - Problem 1

To print tweet to standard out using the following commands...

Using echo:
This one is quite straight forward and just prints tweet to standard out
>> echo tweet

Using cat:
First create a file that only contains the word tweet.
>> echo tweet > tweet.txt
Then use cat to read the file to standard out.
>> cat tweet.txt

Using ls:
Create a new directory with no other files in it.
>> mkdir tweetFolder
Then make one file called tweet.
>> touch tweet
Finally, use ls to print that file name.
>> ls

Using grep:
Create a file that has only the word tweet in it.
>> echo tweet > tweet.txt
Use grep on the text file that has only the word tweet in it.
>> grep tweet tweet.txt

Using !!:
Create a script called tweet with only the shebang and no actual commands.
>> echo '!/bin/bash' > tweet
Make the script executable using chmod.
>> chmod +x tweet
Run the command by typing tweet.
>> tweet
Then type !! to run the last command, it outputs the command name but nothing else since
the script doesn't actually do anything.
>> !!
